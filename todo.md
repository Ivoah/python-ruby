Shift more to - The article focuses on language structure, which isn't very helpful to people when deciding what to code in. It's important to know what you can do in two frameworks/languages, rather than the differences in how you do it.

In addition to the coding sections you may want to highlight other issues, i.e. popularity, community support, number of current job postings, average developer salary, popular companies and which one they use and that sort of stuff.

Also you may want to highlight the different areas where each are more strongly used. For example I think it’s safe to say that ruby is much more strongly used in the DevOps community vs Python in the Scientific / AI / data modelling community.   The web is kind of a toss up, but probably rails is the leading framework these days…. Security probably goes to python, although there are some really popular ruby tools aka Metasploit…
